**Problem Statement:**

People, especially students, lack essential financial knowledge. Many are unaware of concepts like bonds and mutual funds, making them susceptible to financial exploitation. Our solution addresses this issue by making financial education engaging, profitable, and accessible to all.

**The Game:**

Our gamifying experience allows users to navigate through various financial scenarios, earning virtual currency along the way. The power of generative AI dynamically tailors questions, ensuring a personalized and interactive learning journey.

**Customization:**

Understanding that everyone has a unique learning curve, we curate questions based on individual interests, gradually increasing interactivity. Users start by inputting their financial understanding level, and the game adjusts accordingly.

**Use of Generative AI:**

Generative AI is the heart of our project. We pull challenges based on the difficulty according to the person taking it. We specifically pull data in real time at each step as the player progresses. Using generative AI in an education-based game is the need of the hour.

**Gameplay:**

As players progress through levels, they roll a virtual dice, determining their journey's distance. Arriving at destinations prompts interesting challenges. Succeed, and you gain points; fail, and you're faced with educational opportunities to reinforce key concepts.

**Future Expansion:**

Users can seek assistance from an AI assistant when unsure of answers, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of financial concepts. The game concludes after three rounds, ensuring a confident grasp of the topics without monotony. Also, looking forward, we plan to develop more games, making financial education even more interactive and accessible. Clients can use our platform to train employees, creating a ripple effect of financial literacy across various sectors.

**Conclusion:**

With our innovative approach, we're not just changing the way financial education is perceived; we're making it a fun, engaging, and empowering experience. Join us in shaping a financially educated future from an early age.

**How We Built It:**

Python3, PyGame, TKinter, OpenAI

**Challenges We Ran Into:**

We encountered several challenges during the project, including the initial decision between using pygame or kivy. After careful analysis, we opted for pygame but faced limitations in the available features of pygame. Additionally, sprite movement animation proved challenging due to pygame's lack of inherent support for screen refresh. Dealing with OpenAI API integration presented difficulties in obtaining the required answers. Despite these challenges, we persevered and overcame each obstacle, ensuring a successful project.
